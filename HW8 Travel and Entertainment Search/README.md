In this project, I built a responsive website for travel and entertainment search with features such as showing reviews, maps, directions, and photos of places (e.g. restaurants, theaters), creating a favorites list, and posting place information to Twitter.

I employed Google and Yelp APIs, front-end (AngularJS, Bootstrap, jQuery, and Ajax) and back-end (PHP and Node.js) frameworks and Google App Engine.

The objectives of this assignment were to
<ul>
<li>Get familiar with the AJAX and JSON technologies
<li>Use a combination of HTML5, Bootstrap, JQuery, Angular, and PHP/Node.js </li>
<li>Get hands-on experience of Google Cloud App Engine and Amazon Web Services </li>
<li>Get hands-on experience of using Bootstrap to enhance the user experience </li>
<li>Learn to use popular APIs such as Google Places APIs and Yelp APIs </li>
</ul>
