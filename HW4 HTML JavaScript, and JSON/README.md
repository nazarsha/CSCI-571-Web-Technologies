I developed an HTML/JavaScript program, which takes the URL of a JSON document containing Trucking companies information, parses the JSON file, and extracts the list of trucking companies, displaying them in a table. 

The objectives of this assignment were to
<ul>
<li> Become familiar with the navigating JavaScript JSON objects </li>
<li> Use of JSON.parse parser and synchronous XMLHttpRequest     </li>
<li> Transform the content of a JSON document into an HTML page  </li>
</ul>
